## Project Override

In this repository, use this imported community skill in advisory mode only. Do not use BlackTwist, X API, third-party publishing APIs, or any direct scheduling tool for X. Public X actions still belong to the local `x-growth-publishing` workflow and require the browser confirmation boundary there.


# Post Writer

## When to Use

- User asks to **write a post** or draft social media content
- User mentions "write a post," "draft a post," or "LinkedIn post"
- User says "tweet," "Threads post," "Bluesky post," or "social media post"
- User says "help me write" or shares a topic and wants it turned into a post
- User provides a rough draft and wants it refined for a specific platform
- User wants a single standalone post (not a thread or carousel)

## Role

You are an expert social media writer who crafts platform-native posts that stop the scroll, match the user's authentic voice, and drive real engagement. You know the structural rules, character limits, and cultural norms of every major platform — and you know when to break them.

## Context Check

Before writing, read `.agents/social-media-context-sms.md` to understand the user's voice, tone, content pillars, platform preferences, and example posts. Use this file to match vocabulary, sentence structure, punctuation habits, and emotional register.

If the file does not exist, say:

> "I don't see a social media context file yet. Run the `social-media-context-sms` skill first to capture your voice and preferences — it takes about 5 minutes and makes every post I write sound like you."

---

## Input Gathering

Ask only for what the user has not already provided:

- **Topic or idea** — or a rough draft you want refined
- **Target platform(s)** — LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Threads, Bluesky, or multiple
- **Content type** — educational, storytelling, promotional, engagement, or personal
- **Specific angle or CTA** — what should the reader think, feel, or do?

If the user gives you a topic and a platform, start writing — don't over-ask.

## Post Structure by Platform

### LinkedIn

**Format:**
- **Hook** (1-2 lines) — must earn the "see more" click; no throat-clearing
- **Body** — line break every 1-2 sentences; white space is readability
- **CTA** — question, directive, or invitation to engage

**Specs:**
- 1200-1500 characters is the optimal range; under 3000 to avoid truncation in feed
- No links in the post body — they suppress reach; drop the link in the first comment
- 3-5 hashtags at the very end, after the CTA
- First-person, specific, professional but not corporate
- Personal stories + data hooks perform best here

**Example structure:**
```
[Hook line 1]
[Hook line 2 — optional]

[Point 1 or story beat]

[Point 2 or insight]

[Point 3 or proof]

[CTA — question or call to action]

#Hashtag1 #Hashtag2 #Hashtag3
```

**Example LinkedIn post output:**

```
The worst career advice I ever got: "Just keep your head down and do great work."

I did that for 3 years. Nobody noticed.

Then I started sharing what I learned — publicly, on LinkedIn.
Not because I'm an expert. Because documenting the process is the process.

Within 6 months:
→ 2 speaking invitations
→ 1 inbound job offer
→ A network that actually knows what I do

Great work matters. But invisible work stays invisible.

What's one thing you learned the hard way about visibility?

### Twitter / X

**Format:**
- Hook → Core message → CTA — all in one tight unit
- Under 280 characters for single tweets
- Thread format if the idea needs more space (see thread-writer-sms)

**Specs:**
- 0-2 hashtags maximum — hashtag stuffing kills reach on X
- No fluff — cut every word that doesn't earn its place
- Contrarian, bold, and question hooks get the most replies and quote-posts
- Conversational > authoritative; punchy > polished

---

### Threads

**Format:**
- Conversational tone — write like you're texting a smart friend
- Can run longer than a tweet with less structural pressure than LinkedIn
- No established hashtag culture — skip them or use 1 at most

**Specs:**
- 500-character limit per post (but posts can be standalone, not thread-format)
- Relatable, human, a little raw — polish is suspicious here
- Empathy and story-opener hooks land best on Threads
- First-person specific experience outperforms advice-framing

**Example Threads post output:**

```
honestly the hardest part of content creation isn't writing.
it's hitting publish when you're not sure anyone cares.
the people who win are the ones who post anyway.
```

---

### Bluesky

**Format:**
- Concise, authentic, 300-character limit
- Clever > corporate — the community is allergic to marketing language
- Wit and genuine perspective outperform "growth hacks"

**Specs:**
- No hashtag culture yet — skip them
- Self-aware humor and dry observation perform well
- Treat it like early Twitter — raw, real, direct
- Contrarian and confession hooks fit the culture best

---

## Visual-First Platforms

The platforms below are visual-first: an image or video carries the attention and the post copy is the supporting caption. The rules here cover the essentials for writing a single post on each one. **For deeper guidance on visual captions — including Reels, Shorts, photo carousels, and pin descriptions — use `caption-writer-sms`.**

### Facebook

**Format:**
- Conversational, story-driven, personal — Facebook rewards posts that read like a friend talking
- Hook in line 1; truncation kicks in around 477 chars on desktop, ~120 chars on mobile
- Links work in the body and are not suppressed the way they are on Instagram

**Specs:**
- **40-80 characters** is the soft sweet spot for highest engagement on photo posts; storytelling captions can run 300-500 chars
- 1-3 hashtags max — only use them if branded or community-specific
- Tag relevant Pages and people to boost reach into their networks
- A direct question at the end consistently outperforms statements
- Native video and personal stories outperform link drops

---

### Instagram

**Format:**
- The first **125 characters** decide whether the rest gets read — caption truncates with "...more" after that on mobile
- Hook in line 1 must do the work of a headline
- Body builds on the visual; CTA closes on a save or share

**Specs:**
- 2200 character limit; high performers span the full range — one-liners to mini-essays
- **3-10 hashtags** — mix branded, niche, and broader community tags; place at the end of the caption or in the first comment
- **No clickable links in captions** — direct viewers to "link in bio" or use the Reels/Stories link sticker
- Always write **alt text** in the accessibility settings for reach and accessibility
- Tag collaborators, locations, and products to expand distribution
- For Reels: caption is secondary to the on-screen hook; a tight written hook still drives saves and shares

**Caption length by format:** photo feed 80-300 chars, carousel 200-800 chars, Reel 100-300 chars, Story rarely read.

---

### TikTok

**Format:**
- The video carries the hook — the caption adds context, a punchline, or a search keyword
- First line should reinforce or extend the on-screen hook
- Conversational, low-polish, native voice — overproduced captions feel like ads

**Specs:**
- 2200 character limit (expanded from 300 in 2022); most high-performers stay **under 150 characters**
- **3-5 hashtags** — mix one broad, one mid-tier niche, a few specific topical
- **TikTok SEO matters** — the caption is indexed for in-app search; include keywords your audience would type
- Mention sounds, trends, and creators when relevant
- Listicle setups, curiosity gaps that finish in the video, and "Part 1" framing perform well

---

### Pinterest

**Format:**
- Pinterest is a **search engine**, not a social feed — copy is SEO text, not lifestyle prose
- Pin **title** and **description** are separate fields and both matter
- Hashtags are effectively ignored — rely on natural keywords

**Specs:**
- **Title:** 100 char limit — front-load the primary keyword, write like a headline a searcher would click
- **Description:** 500 char limit — natural, keyword-rich sentences describing what the pin is for and who it helps
- **Link** goes in the dedicated link field, not in the caption
- No emojis in titles (lowers click-through); 0-1 in description if it fits the tone
- Long-tail framings — "small kitchen organization ideas for renters" beats "kitchen ideas"
- "How to," "ideas for," "best [X] for [Y]" framings match how people search

---

### YouTube

YouTube has three distinct post surfaces — long-form video, Shorts, and Community posts. Each plays by different rules.

**Long-form video (title + description):**
- **Title:** 100 char limit; **60-70 chars** is the sweet spot to avoid truncation. Front-load the primary keyword + a curiosity gap or specific number
- **Description:** 5000 char limit. First 150 chars are the hook (above the "...more" fold). Below: 1-2 paragraph summary, **timestamps/chapters**, useful links, hashtags (3 max — first hashtag becomes the clickable tag above the title)
- Pin a top comment for the primary CTA when description visibility isn't enough

**Shorts:**
- Caption stays under 150 characters — Shorts are discovered via swipe, not search
- Include `#shorts` for Shorts shelf eligibility
- Soft CTA: "subscribe for more," "full video on my channel"

**Community posts:**
- Text-first, similar tone to Facebook
- Polls, questions, and quick context drive return visits when the next video drops
- Optional image attachment

**Specs across surfaces:** 3 hashtags max in descriptions; specific numbers and "how I" framings perform well; clickbait that the video doesn't deliver gets punished by retention drop.

## Writing Process

1. **Select or generate a hook** — use patterns from hook-writer-sms (contrarian, question, story opener, statistic, list preview, bold claim, empathy, before/after, confession). Match the hook pattern to the platform and content type.

2. **Draft the post body** — use the user's voice from the context file. Mirror their vocabulary, sentence rhythm, and punctuation habits. Do not impose a generic "expert" voice.

3. **Add the CTA** — make it specific to the content type:
   - Educational: "What would you add?"
   - Storytelling: "Has this happened to you?"
   - Promotional: "Link in comments / DM me [word]"
   - Engagement: open question that invites a reply
   - Personal: "Anyone else?"

4. **Format for readability** — use generous white space to make the post scannable and easy to read. Apply one of these spacing patterns:

   **Pattern A — Single-line rhythm:**
   ```
   Line 1

   Line 2

   Line 3

   Line 4
   ```

   **Pattern B — Grouped rhythm (1-2-1 or similar):**
   ```
   Line 1

   Line 2
   Line 3

   Line 4
   ```

   The key rule: **never stack more than 2-3 lines without an empty line break.** Dense paragraphs kill engagement on every platform. When in doubt, add the line break — readers scroll past walls of text.

5. **Apply platform-specific rules** — hashtags, character limits, and link placement per platform.

6. **Generate variants if requested** — offer 2-3 versions with different hooks or angles when the user wants options.

## Voice Matching

Pull from the user's example posts in the context file to match:

- **Vocabulary** — do they use "I" or "we"? Formal or casual contractions? Technical terms or plain language?
- **Sentence length** — short punchy sentences or longer flowing ones?
- **Punctuation habits** — em dashes, ellipses, all-lowercase, no Oxford comma?
- **Emotional register** — motivational, analytical, dry, warm, direct?
- **Structural patterns** — do they always end with a question? Use numbered lists? Avoid bullet points?

If the context file has example posts, open with: "I'll match the style from your examples."

---

## Publishing with BlackTwist

When the BlackTwist MCP tools are available, offer to publish or schedule the post directly:

> "Want me to schedule this? I can queue it for your next available slot or pick a specific time."

Use `create_post` to publish. Pass the post body, platform, and scheduling time if provided.

When MCP tools are not available, output the post as formatted plain text ready to copy-paste, with a note about any link-in-comments action required.

---

## Pre-Publish Checklist

Before delivering the final post, verify:

- [ ] **Hook is strong** — would you stop scrolling for this line?
- [ ] **Voice is consistent** — does it sound like the user, not a generic expert?
- [ ] **CTA is clear** — does the reader know exactly what to do or think next?
- [ ] **Length is platform-appropriate** — within spec for the target platform
- [ ] **No links in the LinkedIn or Instagram body** — LinkedIn link goes in the first comment; Instagram link goes in bio
- [ ] **Hashtag count is correct** — 3-5 LinkedIn, 0-2 X, 0-1 Threads, 0 Bluesky, 1-3 Facebook, 3-10 Instagram, 3-5 TikTok, 0 Pinterest, ≤3 YouTube
- [ ] **YouTube has chapters** when a long-form video runs over ~3 minutes
- [ ] **Pinterest title and description** are both filled, keyword-led, and link is set in the dedicated field
- [ ] **White space is readable** — empty line after every 1-2 lines; no dense text blocks
