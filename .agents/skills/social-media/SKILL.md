# Social Media Post Guidelines

Follow [writing-voice](../writing-voice/SKILL.md) for tone.

## When to Apply This Skill

Use this pattern when you need to:

- Draft LinkedIn, Twitter/X, or Reddit posts about product or technical updates.
- Announce features without hashtags, hype language, or template sections.
- Share implementation details developers actually care about.
- Reshape AI-sounding copy into concise, platform-native writing.
- Build short threads where each post carries a concrete standalone point.

## Platform-Specific Brevity

- **LinkedIn**: 3-5 lines max. State the feature, drop the link, done.
- **Twitter/X**: Each tweet should have ONE idea. Don't overexplain.
- **Reddit technical subs**: Focus on implementation details, not benefits

## What to Remove

- All hashtags except when platform culture expects them
- Section headers in post content ("## Implementation", "## Benefits")
- Bullet lists of features/benefits
- Marketing phrases ("game-changing", "seamless", "powerful")
- Call-to-action phrases ("See it in action!", "Try it today!")
- Redundant adjectives ("excellent", "really")

## What to Add

- Specific technical details that developers care about
- Actual implementation challenges and solutions
- Links to relevant libraries/APIs used
- One unique feature detail ("with your model of choice")
- Disclaimers when recommending tools ("Not affiliated, it just...")
- Personal standards/opinions ("by my standards", "slated for cleanup")
- Proper punctuation for transitions (semicolons, periods; not space-hyphens)

## Examples: Twitter/X

### Single Tweet (Feature Announcement)

Good:

```
Whispering now does file uploads. Drag audio/video files in, get transcription out. Works with any OpenAI-compatible API.

Open source: github.com/EpicenterHQ/epicenter
```

Bad:

```

### Single Tweet (Technical Insight)

Good:

```
TIL: Tauri's onDragDropEvent works where web drag-and-drop doesn't. If you're building a desktop app with web tech, native drag-and-drop is ~20 lines and handles file paths the OS way.
```

Bad:

```
Just discovered something amazing about Tauri! 🤯

Their native drag-and-drop API is incredibly powerful and seamlessly handles file operations that web APIs simply can't match.

This is why I love building with Tauri! 💪
```

The difference: the good tweet teaches something specific. The bad tweet expresses enthusiasm about nothing in particular.

### Thread Structure (2-4 tweets max)

When a single tweet isn't enough, use a short thread. Each tweet should be self-contained enough to make sense if someone sees it in isolation.

Good:

```
Tweet 1:
Built a CRDT-based table storage that's 1935x smaller than Y.Map for the same data. The trick: store cells as "rowId:colId" keys in a flat array with LWW timestamps.

Tweet 2:
Y.Map creates one CRDT entry per key, each with metadata overhead. A flat YKeyValue array stores raw entries with timestamps; conflict resolution happens in userland. 524KB → 271 bytes for a 50-row table.

Tweet 3:
Trade-off: you lose Y.Map's built-in observe() granularity. We rebuilt it with a CellStore layer that parses keys and emits typed change events. Worth it for the storage savings.

```

Bad:

```
Tweet 1:
🧵 Thread: How we achieved a massive 1935x improvement in our CRDT storage! Let me walk you through our journey...

Tweet 2:
First, let's understand the problem. Y.Map is great but creates significant overhead...

Tweet 3:
So what did we do? We implemented an innovative approach using...

Tweet 4:
The results were absolutely incredible! Here are the key benefits:
- 1935x smaller storage
- Faster sync times
- Better conflict resolution

Tweet 5:
If you found this helpful, please RT and follow for more content like this! 🙏
```

The good thread: each tweet has a concrete fact. The bad thread: tweet 1 is a hook, tweet 2 is setup, and the information doesn't start until tweet 3. The "please RT" closer is an instant credibility loss.

## Examples: LinkedIn Posts

### Good (Focused on Implementation)

````
Hey r/sveltejs! Just shipped a file upload feature for Whispering and wanted to share how I implemented drag-and-drop files.

I used the [FileDropZone component from shadcn-svelte-extras](https://www.shadcn-svelte-extras.com/components/file-drop-zone), which provided a clean abstraction that allows users to drop and click to upload files:

```svelte
<FileDropZone
  accept="{ACCEPT_AUDIO}, {ACCEPT_VIDEO}"
  maxFiles={10}
  maxFileSize={25 * MEGABYTE}
  onUpload={(files) => {
    if (files.length > 0) {
      handleFileUpload(files);
    }
  }}
/>
```

The component handles web drag-and-drop, but since Whispering is a Tauri desktop app, drag-and-drop functionality didn't work on the desktop (click-to-select still worked fine). So I reached for Tauri's [onDragDropEvent](https://tauri.app/reference/javascript/api/namespacewebviewwindow/#ondragdropevent) to add native support for dragging files anywhere into the application.

You can see the [full implementation here](link) (note that the code is still somewhat messy by my standards; it is slated for cleanup!).

Whispering is a large, open-source, production Svelte 5 + Tauri app: https://github.com/EpicenterHQ/epicenter

Feel free to check it out for more patterns! If you're building Svelte 5 apps and need file uploads, definitely check out shadcn-svelte-extras. Not affiliated, it just saved me hours of implementation time.

Happy to answer any questions about the implementation!
