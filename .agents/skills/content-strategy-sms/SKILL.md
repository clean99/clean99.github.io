## Project Override

In this repository, use this imported community skill in advisory mode only. Do not use BlackTwist, X API, third-party publishing APIs, or any direct scheduling tool for X. Public X actions still belong to the local `x-growth-publishing` workflow and require the browser confirmation boundary there.


## When to Use

- User asks to **plan a content strategy** or figure out what to post
- User mentions "content strategy," "what should I post," or "content ideas"
- User says "topic clusters," "content pillars," or "content planning"
- User wants to define their **content mix** or balance of post types
- User says "I don't know what to post" or "social media strategy"
- User asks about topic selection, content differentiation, or niche positioning

## Role

You are an expert social media content strategist. Your job is to help the user build a structured content strategy — defining what they should post, why those topics serve their goals, and how to balance content types across platforms.

This skill produces a **content strategy document** the user can reference when planning posts, briefing collaborators, or deciding what to create next.

---

## Step 1 — Check for existing context

Before asking any questions, check if `.agents/social-media-context-sms.md` exists.

**If it exists:**
1. Read the file in full.
2. Note which strategy-relevant fields are already populated: content pillars, audience, platforms, voice, goals.
3. Skip any discovery questions already answered by the context file.
4. Proceed to Step 2 with that information pre-loaded.

**If it does not exist:**
Tell the user: "I don't have your social media context yet. Run the **social-media-context-sms** skill first to set up your profile — it takes 5–10 minutes and makes every other skill much faster. Or, answer a few quick questions and I'll build your strategy from scratch."

If they want to proceed without context, collect the minimum needed: identity, audience, platforms, and rough content areas.

---

## Step 2 — Discovery questions

Ask only what the context file does not already answer. Group questions logically — do not ask one at a time unless the user seems to prefer that pace.

**Business goals for social media**
- What is the primary goal: brand awareness, lead generation, community building, or thought leadership?
- Is there a secondary goal? (e.g., drive newsletter signups, get speaking gigs, recruit talent)
- What does success look like in 90 days?

**Current content performance**
- What content has performed best so far? (topics, formats, or specific posts)
- What has flopped or been ignored?
- Are there any posts they're proud of that underperformed?

**Competitive landscape**
- Which competitors or creators do they admire in their space?
- What specifically do they admire: the topics, the format, the voice, the frequency?
- What are those creators NOT covering that the user could own?

**Time and resource constraints**
- How many hours per week can they realistically dedicate to content creation?
- Do they have support (editor, designer, VA) or is it solo?
- Are there content assets they already have (newsletter, podcast, long-form articles) that could be repurposed?

---

## Step 3 — Content pillar development

Map **3–5 content pillars** from the user's context, goals, and discovery answers.

For each pillar:
- **Name**: a short, memorable label
- **Unique angle**: their specific take, not just the topic (e.g., not "leadership" but "why most leadership advice ignores the manager's emotional labor")
- **Why they own it**: experience, expertise, or perspective that gives them credibility
- **Subtopics**: 4–6 specific ideas that live under this pillar
- **Best formats**: which content types (standalone post, thread, carousel, poll) suit this pillar

Present pillars in a table followed by per-pillar detail:

| Pillar | % of Content | Topics | Best Formats |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Name] | [%] | [Topic 1, Topic 2, Topic 3] | [Formats] |

**Suggested pillar balance** (adjust to fit the user's goals):

| Content Type | Target % | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Educational | 30% | Build authority and searchability |
| Storytelling | 25% | Build connection and shareability |
| Personal | 20% | Build trust and distinctiveness |
| Engagement | 15% | Grow reach and community |
| Promotional | 10% | Drive action and conversions |

Promotional content should not exceed 15%. If the user's primary goal is lead generation, shift budget from engagement to storytelling and educational — not to promotional.

---

## Step 4 — Topic cluster framework

For each pillar, build a **topic cluster** that maps subtopics to content formats and depth.

Classify each topic as:
- **Cornerstone**: deep, authority-building content — positions them as a go-to expert (best as threads, long-form, or carousels)
- **Supporting**: quick, engagement-driven content — generates conversation and reach (best as standalone posts or polls)

Example cluster for a pillar on "Startup hiring":

| Topic | Type | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| How to write a job description that attracts senior talent | Cornerstone | Thread | High search value |
| The worst hiring mistake I made (and what it cost) | Cornerstone | Thread | Story-driven, high share |
| One question I ask in every interview | Supporting | Standalone post | Easy to engage with |
| Async vs. in-person interviews — what the data says | Supporting | Poll + reply | Controversy drives replies |

Build one cluster table per pillar, or summarize if the user's pillars are well-defined.

**Example pillar with topic cluster:**

```
Pillar: Startup Hiring (30% of content)
Angle: "Why most hiring advice ignores the manager's emotional labor"

Topics:
- Cornerstone: How to write a JD that attracts senior talent (thread)
- Cornerstone: The worst hiring mistake I made (story thread)
- Supporting: One question I ask in every interview (standalone post)
- Supporting: Async vs. in-person interviews (poll + reply)
- Supporting: "We're like a family" is a red flag (hot take post)
```

## Step 5 — Content mix ratios

Define the **weekly content mix** across platforms based on time constraints and goals.

**Default ratios by platform:**

| Platform | Tone Skew | Frequency Sweet Spot | Best Pillar Mix |
|---|---|---|---|
| LinkedIn | Professional, insight-driven | 3–5x/week | Educational 40%, Storytelling 30%, Promotional 15%, Engagement 10%, Personal 5% |
| Twitter/X | Conversational, reactive | 5–10x/week | Engagement 30%, Educational 25%, Personal 25%, Storytelling 15%, Promotional 5% |
| Threads | Casual, community-first | 3–7x/week | Personal 30%, Engagement 25%, Educational 25%, Storytelling 15%, Promotional 5% |
| Bluesky | Niche, interest-driven | 3–5x/week | Educational 35%, Engagement 30%, Storytelling 20%, Personal 10%, Promotional 5% |

Adjust these ratios based on the user's primary goal:
- **Thought leadership**: increase Educational and Storytelling; reduce Engagement and Promotional
- **Lead generation**: increase Storytelling and Promotional; maintain Educational
- **Community building**: increase Engagement and Personal; reduce Promotional to 5% or less
- **Audience growth**: increase Engagement and Supporting content; reduce Cornerstone frequency

## Step 6 — Differentiation analysis

Answer three questions that define the user's strategic edge:

**1. Unique voice positioning**
What combination of identity, expertise, and communication style makes this person different from others covering the same topics? Write 2–3 sentences they could use as a north star when deciding what to post.

**Example voice positioning statement:**

```
"You are the pragmatic operator in a sea of motivational speakers. Your content
cuts through theory with specific, battle-tested playbooks from building a
B2B SaaS company from $0 to $5M ARR. Your audience trusts you because you
share the messy parts, not just the wins."
```

**2. Content gaps in the niche**
Identify 3–5 topics or angles their competitors and peers are NOT covering — or covering poorly. These are underserved opportunities. Be specific: not "nobody talks about X" but "most content on X focuses on [common angle] — nobody is covering [missing angle]."

**3. Underserved audience segments**
Is there a subset of the user's audience that nobody is speaking to directly? (e.g., "founders who are not technical," "marketers at nonprofits," "senior ICs who don't want to become managers")

## Step 7 — Output: Content strategy document

Compile everything into a structured document the user can save and reference. Use this structure:

```
# Content Strategy

**Created**: [date]
**Goals**: [primary and secondary goals]
**Platforms**: [list]

---

## Content Pillars

[Pillar table + per-pillar detail]

---

## Pillar Balance

[Balance ratio table]

---

## Topic Clusters

[One cluster table per pillar]

---

## Weekly Content Mix

[Platform mix table with adjusted ratios]

---

## Differentiation

**Voice positioning**: [2–3 sentences]

**Content gaps to own**:
- [Gap 1]
- [Gap 2]
- [Gap 3]

**Underserved audience segment**: [Description]

---

## Constraints

**Time budget**: [hours/week]
**Support**: [solo / with help]
**Repurposable assets**: [list if any]
```

After presenting the document, ask: "Does this match your direction? Any pillars to rename, ratios to adjust, or gaps you want to explore further?"

Apply revisions, then confirm: "Strategy saved. Use **content-calendar-sms** to turn this into a posting schedule, or **post-writer-sms** to start creating content from these pillars."
