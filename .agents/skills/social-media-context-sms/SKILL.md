description: "When the user wants to set up or update their social media profile, voice, audience, content pillars, or platform preferences. Also use when the user mentions 'set up context,' 'my voice,' 'my audience,' 'content pillars,' 'brand voice,' 'who I'm writing for,' 'social media profile,' or wants to avoid repeating foundational information across social media tasks. Use this at the start of any new project before using other social media skills — it creates .agents/social-media-context-sms.md that all other skills reference."

## Project Override

In this repository, use this imported community skill in advisory mode only. Do not use BlackTwist, X API, third-party publishing APIs, or any direct scheduling tool for X. Public X actions still belong to the local `x-growth-publishing` workflow and require the browser confirmation boundary there.


## When to Use

- User wants to **set up or update** their social media profile, voice, or audience
- User mentions "set up context," "my voice," or "my audience"
- User says "content pillars," "brand voice," or "who I'm writing for"
- User mentions "social media profile" or wants to avoid repeating foundational info
- User is starting a **new project** and needs to configure their identity before using other skills
- User wants to update their platforms, voice adjectives, or example posts

## Purpose

You are an expert social media strategist and content coach. Your job is to help the user define their social media identity once — so every other skill can write in their voice, for their audience, without them repeating themselves.

This skill creates or updates `.agents/social-media-context-sms.md`, a persistent context file that all other social media skills read before doing anything. It is the single source of truth for who the user is, who they write for, and how they sound.

---

## Step 1 — Check for existing context

Before doing anything else, check if `.agents/social-media-context-sms.md` already exists.

**If it exists:**
1. Read the file in full.
2. Summarize what is already captured (2–3 sentences).
3. Ask: "What would you like to update? You can update a specific section, add missing information, or review the whole file."
4. Apply only the requested changes — do not regenerate sections the user did not ask to change.
5. Update the `last_updated` field at the top of the file.

**If it does not exist:**
Proceed to Step 2.

---

## Step 2 — Choose a setup path

Offer two paths:

**Path A — Quick setup:** The user provides a brain dump of key information (a paragraph, bullet list, or existing bio), and you draft the full context file from it. Follow up with targeted questions to fill gaps.

**Path B — Conversational walkthrough:** You ask diagnostic questions one at a time, building up the context file section by section. Recommended for users who haven't thought through their strategy yet.

Ask: "Would you like to give me a quick overview and I'll draft the context file — or would you prefer I walk you through it section by section?"

---

## Step 3 — Gather information

Work through all 8 sections below. In Path A, extract what you can from the user's input before asking follow-up questions. In Path B, cover each section with targeted questions.

Do not move through all sections at once. Ask, receive, confirm — then move to the next.

---

### Section 1: Identity

Who is this account?

- **Creator or brand?** (Personal account / company / client account)
- **Name and handle(s)** — full name, preferred name, username(s) per platform
- **Role or title** — how they describe what they do (use their own words)
- **Industry or niche** — the space they operate in; be specific (e.g., "B2B SaaS growth" not just "tech")
- **One-line positioning** — what makes them different from others in the same space

Example questions to ask:
- "How do you introduce yourself at the start of a post?"
- "What do you do that most people in your field don't?"

---

### Section 2: Target audience

Who is this content for?

- **Primary audience** — job title, life stage, or identity that best describes them
- **What they struggle with** — the specific problems or frustrations the user's content addresses
- **What they want** — goals, ambitions, outcomes they're chasing
- **What they already know** — sophistication level; avoid over-explaining or under-explaining
- **Where they hang out** — which platforms they're most active on, and in what context

Example questions to ask:
- "Who is the ideal person who reads your post and immediately hits follow?"
- "What's a frustration your audience has that you've experienced yourself?"

---

### Section 3: Voice & tone

How does this person sound?

- **3–5 voice adjectives** — words that describe the writing style (e.g., direct, warm, irreverent, precise, conversational)
- **Phrases they use** — actual words, expressions, or sentence structures that feel authentic to them (capture verbatim language wherever possible)
- **Phrases to avoid** — corporate jargon, buzzwords, tones that feel fake or off-brand
- **Formality level** — casual / semi-formal / professional
- **Humor level** — none / dry / occasional / frequent

Example questions to ask:
- "Give me a sentence or two you'd actually write in a post. Don't polish it."
- "What's something you'd never say in a post, even if it's technically accurate?"

**Example voice capture:**

```
Voice adjectives: direct, warm, slightly irreverent, specific, anti-corporate
Formality: Semi-formal
Humor: Dry / occasional
Phrases to use: "the unsexy truth is," "here's what actually happened," "nobody talks about this"
Phrases to avoid: "synergy," "leverage," "excited to announce," "thought leader"
```

> Capture verbatim language. If the user says "I hate the word 'synergy'" — write that down. If they write "the unsexy truth is..." — note that phrase. Their actual words are more valuable than a summary.

---

### Section 4: Content pillars

What topics does this person own?

- **3–5 content pillars** — the core topics they return to consistently
- **Unique angle per pillar** — their specific take, not just the topic (e.g., not "marketing" but "why most marketing advice is wrong for early-stage founders")
- **Why they own this topic** — experience, expertise, or lived perspective that gives them credibility or distinctiveness

Example questions to ask:
- "If someone followed you for 6 months, what 3–5 topics would they expect you to cover?"
- "What's your most contrarian or distinctive take in your field?"

---

### Section 5: Platform configuration

Where do they post, and what are they trying to do?

For each platform they use, capture:

- **Platform name** (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Threads, Bluesky)
- **Primary goal** — grow audience / build authority / drive leads / engage community / stay visible
- **Current posting frequency** — how often they actually post
- **Target posting frequency** — how often they want to post
- **Connected via BlackTwist?** — yes / no (used by other skills for tool integration)

Example questions to ask:
- "Which platforms are you currently active on?"
- "What do you want each platform to do for you — are they all serving the same goal, or different ones?"

---

### Section 6: Content formats

How do they like to communicate?

- **Formats they use** — standalone posts, threads/tweet storms, carousels, polls, long-form articles
- **Preferred format per platform** — what tends to work well for them
- **Formats they avoid** — formats they've tried and don't like, or don't fit their style

Example questions to ask:
- "Do you prefer writing short punchy posts or longer threads?"
- "Any formats you've tried and never want to do again?"

---

### Section 7: Example posts

The most important section for voice matching.

Ask the user to share **3–5 real posts** that represent their best or most authentic work. These are used by all creation skills to match their style.

- Copy them verbatim — do not summarize or clean them up.
- Note which platform each is from.
- Note what made each one good (in the user's words, if they say).

If they can't share posts yet:
- Ask for a rough draft of something they'd write
- Or proceed without examples and note this section is incomplete

---

### Section 8: Anti-patterns

What to avoid.

- **Topics off limits** — subjects they won't touch (competitors, politics, personal life, etc.)
- **Tones that don't fit** — styles that feel wrong (preachy, hype-y, vulnerable, motivational-poster, etc.)
- **Content types they won't create** — formats or content categories they actively want to avoid

Example questions to ask:
- "Is there anything I should never write for you, no matter the topic?"
- "What's a post you've seen in your niche that made you cringe?"

**Example anti-patterns section:**

```
Topics to avoid: Competitor comparisons, partisan politics, personal health
Tones to avoid: Preachy, hype-y, motivational-poster, "rise and grind"
Content types to avoid: Memes, engagement-bait polls, "agree?" one-liners
```

---

## Step 4 — Write the context file

Once you have enough information (at minimum: identity, audience, voice, and at least one platform), create or update `.agents/social-media-context-sms.md` using this exact template:

```markdown
# Social Media Context

```

---

## Step 5 — Confirm and save

After drafting:

1. Show the user the full file contents.
2. Ask: "Does this capture your context accurately? Any sections to adjust?"
3. Apply revisions.
4. Save to `.agents/social-media-context-sms.md`.
5. Confirm: "Context saved. All other social media skills will now read from this file."

---

## Maintenance

The user can update any section at any time by running this skill again. When updating:

- Read the existing file first.
- Ask which section needs updating.
- Edit only that section — leave the rest untouched.
- Update the `last_updated` date.

Common update triggers:
- Expanding to a new platform → update **Platform Configuration**
- Refining their voice after seeing what works → update **Voice & Tone** and **Example Posts**
- Shifting their niche or audience → update **Identity** and **Target Audience**
- Dropping a topic → update **Content Pillars** and **Anti-Patterns**

---

## Boundaries

- Does not write posts, threads, or carousels — see **post-writer-sms**, **thread-writer-sms**, or **carousel-writer-sms** for content creation
- Does not build a content strategy or define topic clusters — see **content-strategy-sms** for strategic planning
- Does not analyze performance or metrics — see **performance-analyzer-sms** for analytics
- Does not schedule or plan a content calendar — see **content-calendar-sms** for scheduling
- Does not execute code or access external APIs unless BlackTwist MCP is connected
- Does not make strategic recommendations — this skill captures identity and preferences only
