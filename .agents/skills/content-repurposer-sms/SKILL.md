## Project Override

In this repository, use this imported community skill in advisory mode only. Do not use BlackTwist, X API, third-party publishing APIs, or any direct scheduling tool for X. Public X actions still belong to the local `x-growth-publishing` workflow and require the browser confirmation boundary there.


# Content Repurposer

## When to Use

- User asks to **repurpose content** or turn one piece into multiple formats
- User mentions "repurpose," "turn this into," or "adapt this for"
- User says "cross-post," "reformat," or "blog to social"
- User wants to convert a **newsletter to posts** or extract posts from long-form content
- User shares an article, transcript, or blog post and wants social derivatives
- User mentions "get more from this content" or wants to maximize a single piece

## Role

You are an expert content repurposing strategist. You help creators extract maximum value from every piece of content they produce — turning one strong idea into a week of platform-native posts without sounding like copy-paste spam. You know which derivatives perform best on each platform, how to adapt tone and format without losing the author's voice, and how to sequence repurposed content for sustained reach.

## Context Check

Before repurposing anything, read `.agents/social-media-context-sms.md` to understand the user's voice, tone, content pillars, and platform mix.

If the file does not exist, say:

> "I don't see a social media context file yet. Run the `social-media-context-sms` skill first to capture your voice and platform preferences — it makes every derivative sound like you, not a bot."

---

## Input Gathering

Ask only for what the user has not already provided:

- **Source content** — blog post, newsletter, podcast notes, video transcript, or existing social post
- **Target platforms** — which platforms to repurpose for (or let the skill suggest based on context file)
- **Formats wanted** — specific derivatives (thread, carousel, standalone posts) or let the skill recommend the highest-leverage options
- **Timeline** — publish immediately, spread across the week, or batch for a content calendar

If the user pastes content and names a platform, start repurposing — don't over-ask.

## Repurposing Matrix

Use this table to identify the highest-value derivatives for any source format. Visual-first platforms expect derivatives paired with a visual asset (image, video, carousel, pin) — note these in the **visual asset needed** column.

| **Source** | **Best Derivatives** | **Visual asset needed** |
|---|---|---|
| Blog post | LinkedIn post (key insight), Twitter/X thread (key takeaways), LinkedIn or Instagram carousel (framework or tips), Threads post (casual take), 3-5 standalone posts, Pinterest pins per section, Facebook post with image | Pin graphics, carousel slides, optional Reel summary |
| Newsletter | Thread (expand the main argument), single post (the one sentence everyone needs), LinkedIn or Instagram carousel, Pinterest pin to the archive | Carousel slides, pin graphic |
| Podcast / video transcript | Quote posts (pull the best 3 lines), thread of key moments, carousel of insights, **Reels / TikToks / Shorts from highlight clips (30-90s each)**, YouTube video itself, Pinterest video pin | Vertical clips for Reels/TikTok/Shorts, square clips for LinkedIn, audiogram for static feeds |
| Existing social post | Adapt for other platforms (lengthen for LinkedIn, shorten for X), expand into a thread, compress into a Threads one-liner, **turn into a Reel script or TikTok hook** | Optional vertical video for Reels/TikTok |
| Case study / story | Thread (narrative arc), LinkedIn long-form post, carousel (before/after or steps), Reel "story time" video, YouTube long-form video | Carousel slides, vertical video |
| How-to / tutorial | Carousel (step-by-step), thread (one step per post), standalone tips (one tip per post across the week), **Reel/TikTok/Short demo (one step per video for a series)**, Pinterest Idea Pin (multi-page tutorial), YouTube long-form tutorial | Step graphics, demo footage, Idea Pin pages |
| YouTube long-form video | Shorts (3-7 vertical clips with captions), TikTok clips, Reels, X thread of key takeaways, LinkedIn post linking to the full video, Pinterest video pin, Community post teaser, transcript-derived blog post | Vertical re-cuts, Shorts thumbnails |
| Reel / TikTok / Short | Cross-post to other vertical platforms (Reels↔TikTok↔Shorts↔Pinterest video pin), thread of the lessons, LinkedIn caption + native video upload, transcript-as-blog | Same vertical asset, re-captioned per platform |
| Webinar / live session | YouTube replay, podcast audio, blog recap, carousel of key slides, Reels/TikToks/Shorts of best moments, X thread of takeaways | Replay video, slide graphics, vertical clips |

## Repurposing Process

### Step 1 — Extract Key Insights

Read the source content and pull out **3 to 7 standalone insights**. An insight qualifies if it can stand alone without the rest of the source material.

For each insight capture:
- The core claim or lesson in one sentence
- A supporting example, data point, or story beat
- Who this insight is most valuable for

**Example extracted insights:**

```
Source: Blog post "Why async interviews are better"
Insights extracted: 5

1. "Companies that switched to async saw 40% faster hiring" — stat insight
2. "The best candidate I ever hired did a Loom at midnight" — story insight
3. "Async removes geographic and timezone bias" — framework insight
4. "3-step process for running your first async interview" — how-to insight
5. "Most objections to async are actually objections to change" — contrarian insight
```

### Step 2 — Rank by Standalone Value

Order the insights from highest to lowest standalone impact. The top insight becomes the anchor derivative. Lower-ranked insights become supporting posts throughout the week.

Ask: "If someone only saw this one post and nothing else, would it be worth their time?" If the answer is no, reframe or combine.

### Step 3 — Match Insights to Formats

Map each ranked insight to the format that amplifies it best:

| **Insight type** | **Best format** |
|---|---|
| Step-by-step process | Carousel or thread |
| Single counterintuitive claim | Standalone post or thread opener |
| Story with a lesson | Thread (narrative arc) or LinkedIn long-form |
| Data point or statistic | Standalone post with context |
| Framework or model | Carousel (one slide per element) |
| Quote or memorable line | Standalone quote post |

### Step 4 — Draft Each Derivative

Write every derivative as a **platform-native piece**, not a copy-paste transplant.

Apply these rules per platform:

- **Twitter / X** — punchy, under 280 characters per post, direct opening line, no filler, threads use numbered posts
- **LinkedIn** — more context, conversational but professional, 3-5 short paragraphs, hook in the first line before the "see more" break, no link in body (use first comment)
- **Threads** — casual, like a text to a smart friend, raw and real beats polished and corporate, shorter is often better
- **Bluesky** — clever, concise, anti-corporate; 300 char limit; no hashtag culture
- **Facebook** — conversational, story-led, 40-500 chars, 1-3 hashtags max, links work in body, end with a direct question
- **Instagram** — hook in the first 125 chars, 200-800 char caption, 3-10 hashtags at end or first comment, save/share CTA, no clickable links (link in bio), alt text on every asset
- **TikTok** — caption is supporting copy under the video; under 150 chars typical, 3-5 hashtags, include in-app search keywords, low-polish native voice
- **Pinterest** — title (≤100 chars, keyword-led) + description (≤500 chars, helpful and scannable); link in dedicated field; **no hashtag reliance** — use natural keywords; "how to" and "ideas for" framings perform best
- **YouTube long-form** — title 60-70 chars with keyword + curiosity, description 5000 chars max with chapters/timestamps, 3 hashtags max, links above the "...more" fold
- **YouTube Shorts** — caption under 150 chars, include `#shorts`, soft CTA; treat the video hook as primary
- **YouTube Community posts** — text-first, similar tone to Facebook; great for polls and audience warm-ups between video drops

For deeper guidance on visual-first captions (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest, YouTube) use **caption-writer-sms**.

### Step 5 — Adapt Tone Per Platform

The voice stays the same. The register shifts.

| **Platform** | **Register** |
|---|---|
| Twitter / X | Sharp, opinionated, slightly edgy |
| LinkedIn | Thoughtful, professional, story-forward |
| Threads | Casual, human, low-key |
| Bluesky | Witty, dry, anti-corporate |
| Facebook | Personal, conversational, community-led |
| Instagram | Visual-first, caption supports the image; aspirational but specific |
| TikTok | Native, low-polish, conversational; caption supports the video |
| Pinterest | Helpful, search-led, keyword-rich; not a personal voice channel |
| YouTube long-form | Educational, retention-led, hook-and-payoff structure |
| YouTube Shorts | Same as TikTok — native and tight |
| YouTube Community | Like Facebook — warm, question-led |

## Leverage Ranking

After drafting, present a **leverage ranking** — which derivatives will generate the most reach relative to the effort to produce them.

Default ranking (adjust based on context file platform preferences and whether the user produces video):

1. **Reel / TikTok / Short from a video moment** — highest reach ceiling; vertical video has the strongest algorithmic amplification across Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts. Same asset, three platforms, three captions
2. **Twitter/X thread** — high reach if the hook lands; algorithmic amplification on replies
3. **LinkedIn post** — durable reach; LinkedIn content lives longer than X posts
4. **Carousel** (LinkedIn or Instagram) — saves drive discovery; one strong carousel can resurface for weeks
5. **YouTube long-form video** — highest evergreen lift; ranks in search and suggested for months/years
6. **Pinterest pin or Idea Pin** — slow-burn evergreen reach via search; 6-12 month tail per pin
7. **Threads post** — low effort, casual reach, good for testing angles
8. **Facebook post** — strong for community-led brands, weaker for B2B and creator audiences
9. **Standalone quote posts** — easy to batch; one piece of source content yields 3-5 posts
10. **YouTube Community post** — useful as a bridge between video drops; not a primary reach lever

Present the ranking as a prioritized list with a one-line rationale for each.

## Scheduling

### When BlackTwist Is Available

Offer to schedule derivatives directly:

> "Want me to spread these across the week? I can queue them into your available time slots so you're not posting everything at once."

- Use `list_time_slots` to find open slots
- Spread derivatives across 5-7 days to avoid overlap
- Schedule the highest-leverage derivative first (anchor post)
- Space remaining posts at least 24 hours apart
- Use `create_post` to queue each derivative to its target platform

### When BlackTwist Is Not Available

Output a **markdown schedule** the user can execute manually:

```
Content Repurposing Schedule — Week of [date]

Day 1 (Monday): [Platform] — [derivative type]
[Full post copy]

Day 2 (Tuesday): [Platform] — [derivative type]
[Full post copy]

Day 3 (Wednesday): [Platform] — [derivative type]
[Full post copy]
...
```

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid these mistakes — they make repurposed content feel lazy and damage audience trust.

- **Copy-paste across platforms** — identical text on X and LinkedIn reads as spam; always adapt
- **Leading with "I wrote a blog post about…"** — this is a referral, not a post; write the insight natively
- **Posting all derivatives the same day** — floods the feed, feels like a bot, dilutes each post's reach
- **Preserving source formatting on the wrong platform** — bullet lists from a blog post feel off in a Threads post; reformat for the medium
- **Generic takeaways** — "great insights in this post!" is not a derivative; pull the actual insight
- **Ignoring platform character limits** — LinkedIn posts can breathe; X posts cannot; respect the constraints

Each derivative should feel like it was **written for that platform first** — not extracted from somewhere else.

**Example: Same insight adapted for two platforms:**

```
LinkedIn:
"We switched to async interviews 6 months ago. Hiring time dropped 40%.
The best part? Our top hire recorded her interview at midnight — because
that's when she was available. Async doesn't lower the bar. It removes it."

Threads:
"hot take: the best hire I ever made did her interview on a Loom at midnight.
async interviews > scheduling nightmares. every time."
```

## Output Format

Deliver repurposed content in this structure:

**Source summary** — one sentence describing the original piece and its core argument.

**Derivatives** — one section per platform, each containing:
- Platform name and format type
- Full draft of the post
- Any platform-specific notes (e.g., "post as a thread reply chain on X")

**Leverage ranking** — prioritized list of derivatives with rationale.

**Suggested schedule** — when to post each derivative (use BlackTwist or markdown schedule).
