## Project Override

In this repository, use this imported community skill in advisory mode only.
It may inform X hooks, thread shape, AI-writing avoidance, and technical style review.
Do not use macOS Notes integration, external scheduling, third-party publishing APIs,
X APIs, or any direct public action. Public X publishing, image upload, replies, likes,
reposts, follows, profile edits, and pinning remain owned by the local
`x-growth-publishing` workflow and its browser confirmation boundary.

For Clean993 content, prefer the local Chinese constraints from
`.agents/social-media-context-sms.md`, `x-technical-sharing`, and `humanizer-zh`.
Reject generic English growth-copy defaults, engagement bait, and the
`not X, but Y` reframing pattern.

## Writing Workflow

### 1. Select Platform & Format

Choose based on:

- **Audience**: Where do they spend time?
- **Content depth**: Quick insight vs deep dive
- **Goal**: Engagement, education, announcement

### 2. Load Style Reference

Before writing:

1. Read platform-specific guide
2. Read [ai-avoidance.md](references/ai-avoidance.md) — critical for human voice
3. Read [style-guide.md](references/style-guide.md) for tone

### 3. Draft Content

Apply platform constraints from start. Style informs structure.

### 4. Quality Check

Run through checklist below before posting.

## Universal Quality Checklist

### Voice

- [ ] Sounds like a person, not AI?
- [ ] Zero banned words (delve, unleash, harness, leverage)?
- [ ] Zero em-dashes (—)?
- [ ] Contractions used naturally?

### Specificity

- [ ] Includes names, numbers, tools, dates?
- [ ] Concrete examples, not hypotheticals?
- [ ] Would I bookmark this if someone else wrote?

### Structure

- [ ] Hook in first line?
- [ ] Sentence lengths vary (5-40 words)?
- [ ] Each paragraph/tweet can stand alone?

### Value

- [ ] Teaches something specific?
- [ ] Actionable today?
- [ ] From real experience?

## X Quick Start

### Single Post Pattern

```
[Hook - stop the scroll]

[Context or specific detail]

[Insight or learning]

[Optional: engagement question]
```

**Example:**

```
Shipped curation v1 for agents.foo today.

Discovery is way harder than app stores. Agents are conversations, not static features.

Had to rebuild around context matching instead of keyword search.
```

### Thread Pattern

```
1/N [Bold hook - main insight] 👇

2/N [Context or setup]

3-N/N [Key points, one per tweet]

N/N [Summary + CTA]
```

**Rules:**

- First tweet MUST end with 👇 or 🧵 to signal thread
- Use N/M numbering (1/7, 2/7... 7/7)
- Each tweet must stand alone
- Max 5-7 tweets (longer = blog post)

## High-Engagement Content Patterns

| Pattern                  | Structure                                    | Best For           |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Shipped X, Learned Y** | What shipped + key learning + why it matters | Project updates    |
| **How to X**             | Problem + steps + key insight                | Tutorials          |
| **Problem → Solution**   | Problem + failed attempts + what worked      | Case studies       |
| **Contrarian**           | Popular belief + why wrong + your evidence   | Thought leadership |
| **Tool Recommendation**  | Tool + specific benefit + real example       | Resources          |

## Content Selection: What to Share

### Always Share ✓

- Shipped work + learnings
- Non-obvious insights
- Tool recommendations with specifics
- Solutions to common problems

### Skip ✗

- Generic progress updates
- Plans before execution
- Obvious observations
- Engagement bait ("RT if you agree")
- Vague hype

## Critical Prohibitions

- Do not use words: delve, unleash, harness, leverage, robust, seamless, game-changer, unlock
- Do not use em-dashes (—) anywhere
- Do not use "It's not X, it's Y" pattern
- Do not ask for engagement ("RT if you agree", "What do you think?")
- Do not use formal transitions (Furthermore, Moreover, Additionally)
- Do not write uniform sentence lengths
- Do not skip the hook
